# Databricks_utils

A collection of Databricks utility notebooks and patterns we have encountered
in our work with clients across various industries. 

These notebooks can range in sophistication greatly from quick, re-useable work-arounds,
to large frameworks and anything in between.


#### Submissions

Although we will keep the bar for submission low to encourage re-use over re-writing code,
there are a few guidelines to keep this repo healthy:

1. Mardown cells should used used in notebook files to make code/process understandable
2. A Purpose markdown cell should be the first cell in any notebook
3. this Purpose markdown cell should be copied to a README.md file and placed in the repo directory with the notebook to allow github readers to read it easily
4. All sensitive information should be scrubbed before any commits
